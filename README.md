# Website-Portfolio
This E-Portfolio was coded for a Final Assignment. The Course/Subject was about Web Development. Website link: https://bi-yotch.github.io/Website-Portfolio/index.html

### How To
The website is **not responsive** and hence it would be suggested to view the website on a laptop, a 13 inch screen works best. However, if you're on a different sized laptop then **zooming in or zooming out** on your browser will make the website fit right.
